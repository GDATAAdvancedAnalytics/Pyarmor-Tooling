# Pyarmor v8+ tooling

This repository contains some scripts for statically decrypting Python scripts protected with Pyarmor v8 or higher.

## Usage

Initial preparation: Go into `py312` and run `docker build -t pyarmor312 .`. Also create a virtual env where you install `pycryptodome`.

1. Open up the native Pyarmor module in IDA, find the MD5 key derivation function, adjust `ida_getkey.py` and run it in IDAPython. Adjust `decrypt_gcm.py` with the key you obtained.
1. Run `python decrypt_gcm.py /path/to/malware/malware.py`
1. Run `docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd)/analyze_crypted_code.py:/script.py:ro -v /path/to/malware:/data -it pyarmor312 /script.py /data/malware.py.dec`
1. Run `python decrypt_gcm.py /path/to/malware/malware.py.dec` - it will now use the json file generated by the step above to decrypt individual functions and generate a `dec2` file
1. Run `docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd)/disassemble.py:/script.py:ro -v /path/to/malware:/data -it pyarmor312 /script.py /data/malware.py.dec2`, which will fully disassemble the Python bytecode


## Finding the key derivation function

Go to the PyInit export and scroll almost all the way down, until you see a place like this:

Inside that function you'll find the necessary details for `ida_getkey.py`.


# Custom Python notes

The Docker image builds a custom Python version that is able to read objects serialized by Pyarmor.

The difference to 'normal' Python is that code objects have an additional string/array at the end.
Since the normal unmarshaler doesn't expect this, it runs into an "unknown type" error.

The patch introduces an `armor` flag into `RFILE` so that we can only apply the changed logic for explicit calls to `marshal.load(file: SupportsRead[bytes])`.
Otherwise, Python breaks because it cannot unmarshal its builtin objects.

**If you have a protected version that utilizes a different Python version, you need to build that specific version and possibly adjust the patch.**
